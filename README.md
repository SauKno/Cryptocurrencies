# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview of the Project
An investment bank, Accountability Accounting, is interested in providing cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its clients. They do not have much experience with cryptocurrencies so they have asked that a report be made that includes which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and potential classification system for them ot be grouped for the portfolio. 

There is no known output for what they are looking for so we will use unsupervised machine learning and use the clustering algorithm. We will then use dta visualization to present our findings to the board.
